# PI-Vision — Physics-Informed Vision & Imaging

**PI-Vision** is a research group focused on advancing the science of imaging through novel sensors, physics-aware computation, and machine learning. We push the limits of what can be seen — revealing new insights about our world and the cosmos.

## 🔬 Research Themes

- **Physics-informed inference**  
  Inverse problems, optimization, and uncertainty-aware reconstruction grounded in physical models.

- **Computational imaging systems**  
  Optical, radio, and time-resolved sensing; hybrid hardware–software co-design.

- **Neural representations & differentiable simulation**  
  Neural fields, differentiable rendering, radiative transfer, and simulation-driven learning.

- **Scientific applications**  
  Black hole imaging, protoplanetary disks, exoplanets, atmospheric and cloud tomography, and remote sensing.
